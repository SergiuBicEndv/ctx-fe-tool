# vLab App template

This is the vLab App template based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

## Prerequisites

- `node` 14.15.0 or higher.
- `npm` or `yarn` 1.22 or higher.

## Getting started

To create a new app run the following command:

```
npx ctx-create-app
```

## IDE CONFIGURATION

The templates use Yarn 3 with PnP enabled, and is configured and optimized to be used with VSCODE. If you are using a different IDE, you may need to do some manual configuration, specially for Yarn PnP to work smoothly. If you are having issues with types and dependencies not being recognized, please refer to https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks to setup your editor correctly.
